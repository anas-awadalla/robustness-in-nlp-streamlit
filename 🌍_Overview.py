st.markdown("### Abstract")
st.markdown("""We conduct a large empirical evaluation to
investigate the landscape of distributional 
robustness in question answering. Our 
investigation spans over 350 models and 16
question answering datasets, including a 
diverse set of architectures, model sizes, and
adaptation methods (e.g., fine-tuning, adapter
tuning, in-context learning, etc.). We find
that, in many cases, model variations do
not affect robustness and in-distribution 
performance alone determines out-of-distribution
performance. Moreover, our findings indicate
that i) zero-shot and in-context learning methods
are more robust to distribution shifts than
fully fine-tuned models; ii) few-shot prompt
fine-tuned models exhibit better robustness
than few-shot fine-tuned span prediction models;
iii) parameter-efficient and robustness 
enhancing training methods provide no significant
robustness improvements. In addition,
we publicly release all evaluations to encourage
researchers to further analyze robustness
trends for question answering models""")
